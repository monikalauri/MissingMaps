# Efficient around the world mapping

MapSwipe is an open-source mobile and web app that is making mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. Volunteers swipe through imagery in several different project types, each designed to meet specific mapping needs.

For example, in the “Find features” type of project, volunteers swipe through satellite images to identify & select those that contain the requested features such as buildings, roadways, waterways:

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure-comparison.html src_1="assets/images/pages/MapSwipe-huge-area.png" alt_1="MapSwipe Huge Area" target="_blank" title_1="This would be a huge area for people to map" src_2="assets/images/pages/MapSwipe-result.png" title_2="This is the result of MapSwipe. Much better." alt_2="Result of Mapswipe" full=true %}
