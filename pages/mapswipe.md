  From your internet browser or mobile phone, you can play a part in helping communities around the world, one swipe at a time.
  
  MapSwipe harnesses the collective strength of volunteers to actively contribute to geospatial data projects. From identifying infrastructure to tracking environmental changes and validating map data, MapSwipers help improve map data across the world.

  MapSwipe is an open-source mobile and web app that is making mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. Volunteers swipe through imagery in several different project types, each designed to meet specific mapping needs.

intro: |-
  For example, in the “Find features” type of project, volunteers swipe through satellite images to identify & select those that contain the requested features such as buildings, roadways, waterways:
