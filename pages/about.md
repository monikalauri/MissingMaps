  Missing Maps is a project led by a collective of organizations working towards a common goal of creating accessible map data where humanitarian organizations are operating. Each member organization carries out their own mapping activities with their wider communities guided by shared ethics.
  
  Missing Maps would be nothing without this collaboration of participating organizations, communities and individuals. To achieve this goal, Missing Maps organizations grow a global community of mappers to support those living in places at risk as they put themselves on the map.
  
  Welcome to the community!

# Objectives

- To map areas where people live at risk of disasters and crises by contributing to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) so that individuals, communities and organizations can use the data and maps to better prepare and respond.

- To support [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and humanitarian aid organizations, in developing technologies, skills, workflows, and communities.

- To develop and grow [MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org/en/) and other tools to improve the map data for crisis preparedness and response across the world

# Ethics
## People
People always come before data. All Missing Maps activities will take into account the best interests and rights of the community and individuals, before adding data to OSM.

All Missing Maps project activities are guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.

## Open
Missing Maps project member organizations ensure that all non-sensitive data gathered under the Missing Maps project banner will be free, open and available for use.

Any data added to OpenStreetMap is added under the [ODbL license](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). Any data added to MapSwipe is collected in MapSwipe's [open database](https://mapswipe.org/en/data/).

- [MapSwipe Privacy Policy](https://mapswipe.org/en/privacy/)

Open to all tool creators: Any creation of Missing Maps project methodology, tools, software or technology by Missing Maps project member organizations will be open source and enable global volunteer network contribution.

Open to all voices and perspectives: All Missing Maps project activities are designed to be accessible and open for participation for individuals, communities and organizations who want to contribute towards the Missing Maps project objectives.

## Sustainable
Whenever possible, Missing Maps project activities are undertaken in collaboration with local individuals, communities, and organizations and in a respectful manner at all times.
Missing Maps project activities will build sustainable local capacity, and will ensure access to open mapping community tools and technology, and provide access to training for individuals and communities they work with.

## Collaborative
The Missing Maps community will work together to share, develop, improve and implement mapping and data collection processes.

Missing Maps member organizations will support, grow and learn from the global network of digital humanitarian volunteers.

## Quality
Missing Maps member organizations will ensure that quality assurance and control processes are in place for all of their activities. We are cautious about rapid data collection without significant local participation, and always make efforts to ensure local access.

# Donate to make an impact
[MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org/en/) is an open-source mobile and web app that is making mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. Your donation will help ensure smooth operation, sustainability and maintenance of the apps.

A donation to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (one of the founders of Missing Maps) can help support local people to map their own communities, develop tools and processes so that more people can contribute, and scale this work so that even more responders and humanitarian organisations around the world have maps and open data that enable them to make time-critical, data-driven decisions.

# Communities
We appreciate that Missing Maps activities are often community-organized, whether it is by the existing OSM communities or by local communities of Missing Maps volunteers. This led us to make available an editable version of the Missing Maps logo, so the communities can adapt it by adding their country, or city.
