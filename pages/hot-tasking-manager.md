  The HOT Tasking Manager is an open mapping coordination tool that enables volunteers worldwide to add data to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in a structured way.
  
  It is used by OSM communities, humanitarian organizations, local governments, and others to coordinate remote mapping efforts after disasters and to support resilience building.

  The Tasking Manager allows many individuals to work simultaneously on the same area, ensuring projects can be completed quickly and efficiently through coordinated remote collaboration.
  And you can contribute too!

# First Steps

It is no problem if you have never mapped on the HOT Tasking Manage before. It doesn't take long to learn - just about an afternoon!

## 1. Create an OpenStreetMap and Tasking Manager account

{% include framework/shortcodes/youtube.html id='suk8uRpIBQw' %}

Go to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s [Tasking Manager website](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) to create an account. Follow the link in the email they send to confirm your account.

## 2. Learn to use the Tasking Manager

{% include framework/shortcodes/youtube.html id='wqQdDgjBOvY' %}

Go to the Task Manager to find a project and task that interests you. Learn how to lock a task to edit, select an editing program and change the background settings. Note: when your task is reviewed, you’ll get an email. Make sure to give those a read.

## 3. Learn to map buildings

{% include framework/shortcodes/youtube.html id='nswUcgMfKTM' %}

Buildings are one of the most useful things you can add to OpenStreetMap (and they're fun too)! Learn how to add and edit buildings to OSM through the iD editor.

## 4. Learn to map roads

Roads are also one of the most useful things you can add to OpenStreetMap! Learn how to add and edit roads to OSM through the iD editor.

# Advanced mapping

JOSM is a powerful OpenStreetMap editing tool that will supercharge your mapping abilities! We recommend that mappers who want to take their mapping to the next level progress to using this tool. 
First, you’ll need to download the application. You can do that [here](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Download). This application is available for both Macs and PCs. Compared to iD Editor, the setup process can be no picnic, so give yourself time to navigate this new tool before you plan to jump into your mapping. Once you are using JOSM you’ll never look back!

If you’re interested in a detailed JOSM training, be sure to check out these webinars:

# Validation

Validation is an important part of the Missing Maps process. Getting a second, third, or fourth pair of eyes on mapped features goes a long way in ensuring the quality of data being added to OpenStreetMap and being used in vulnerable communities around the world. Validating requires confidence in your mapping abilities as well as the willingness to help coach and advise newer mappers. The Missing Maps Project is a community of mappers with different levels of mapping experience, all who have a common goal of improving the availability of quality data for humanitarian use.

The second important part of validation is providing feedback to mappers. Let them know we got their back, point them out the right way how to improve and encourage them for the great work they are doing.

## Be a validator

### 1. Identify if becoming a validator is right for you.
Validating isn’t for everyone; validation requires patience and attention to detail. Some experience mapping in OpenStreetMap and HOT projects is a must, but don’t feel that you need to be an expert to start. If you’re new to Missing Maps or OpenStreetMap mapping in general, head over to our resources for new mappers. Check out our [Validation FAQs](https://github.com/MissingMaps/missing-maps-website/blob/main/assets/downloads/en/MissingMaps_validation_faq_en.pdf) to gain some insight on what validating entails.

### 2. Build your skills.
Becoming a more efficient mapper is crucial to becoming a validator. The [JOSM Editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) is a customizable editor for OpenStreetMap with a number of tools and plugins to make mapping and validating easier! Check out this guide to validation using the JOSM editor. For instruction setting up JOSM, you can also head over to [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/en/josm/).

Yes, validating is also possible with iD Editor, but we recommend using JOSM since it is much more effective and has many data quality tools and features that are not possible with ID Editor.

Watch this HOT Training webinar for Introduction into validation:

### 3. Collaborate as part of the broader community.

The best way to get in touch with other validators and the humanitarian mapping community is joining the [HOTOSM Slack](http://slack.hotosm.org/). There are dedicated channels for validation, tasking manager updates, JOSM support and many more!

While there are many ways to do validation, the most effective is live validation during a mapathon. You get to know the community and you give feedback directly to the mapper on the event in real time as they are mapping. You can see a list of them in the Events Calendar.
